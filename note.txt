To prevent the text in the span from overlapping the div and break the line without using the `<br>` element, you can try the following solutions:

Solution 1: Add `word-wrap: break-word;` to the span
```
span {
word-wrap: break-word;
}
```

This will break the line when the text reaches the edge of the div.

Solution 2: Add `overflow-wrap: break-word;` to the span
```
span {
overflow-wrap: break-word;
}
```

This is similar to the first solution, but it's supported by more browsers.

Solution 3: Add `display: inline-block;` and `width: 100%;` to the span
```
span {
display: inline-block;
width: 100%;
}
```

This will make the span take up the full width of the div and break the line when necessary.

Solution 4: Use `flexbox` on the div
```
div {
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

This will make the div a flexible container that wraps its content to a new line when necessary.
